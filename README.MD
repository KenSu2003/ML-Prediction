1. Trains a stock model that predicts future price of a stock.

```bash
python training.py
```

2. Predicts future price using the base model.

```bash
python prediction.py
```

3. Test the accuracy of the prediction of the base model.

```bash
accuracy.py
```

4. Enhance the accuracy of the model using prices from another similar stock.

```bash
enhance.py
```

5. Using the enhanced model to predict a future price.

```bash
test_prediction.py
```

6. tests accuracy of the enhanced model

```bash
test_enhance.py     
```
